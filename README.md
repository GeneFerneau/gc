# Generalized channels

A proof-of-concept implementation to evaluate a UTXO-based generalized channel construction in Bitcoin.

## Usage:

- Install Python >= 3.7.3
- Install dependencies (check requirements.txt)
- execute main.py
- change flag lightning to inspect either the lightning or the generalized channel construction
- inspect stdout output to see raw transactions and size
- optional: enter different private keys and unspent TX outputs, publish resulting transactions on testnet
